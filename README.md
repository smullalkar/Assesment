Summary : In order to complete this assignment i have used React.js library for ui,
Ant-d for styling purpose, i have also done some custom styling wherever required,
react-router for routing purpose, and axios for fetching the api's.

I have tried my best in order reach and complete each and every point mentioned in the assignment.
Functionality wise i have done almost all the points, In terms UI i didn't i have compromised a bit as 
i have given more weightage to functionality and also as time was limited i had to do this tradeoff.
